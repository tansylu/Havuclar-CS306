### **“Analyzing the Relationship between Government, Freedom and Internet Accessibility Worldwide”**


- Why did you select this data set ?

By analyzing these factors, we gained insights into the internet access rate across countries and how it related to various aspects such as community, infrastructure, ISP, government, and policy. The findings from this project provide valuable information for policymakers, organizations, and researchers to make informed decisions and interventions to improve internet access and bridge the digital divide.

- We examined the year when the internet started to be used in each country.
1. Community:
    - We gathered data on the number of internet users in each country.
2. Infrastructure:
    - We assessed access to electricity, differentiating between urban and rural areas, as it was crucial for internet connectivity.
    - We analyzed the share of individuals using the internet to understand the penetration rate.
    - The share of the urban population was examined as it could impact internet access.
3. ISP (Internet Service Provider):
    - We analyzed the number of fixed broadband subscriptions in each country.
    - The number of fixed telephone subscriptions was considered as it could affect internet connectivity.
    - Mobile cellular subscriptions were assessed as mobile networks played a significant role in internet access.
4. Government:
    - We examined economic indicators such as GDP (Gross Domestic Product) to understand the financial context.
    - Government spendings related to infrastructure and technology development were considered.
    - 
5. Policy:
    - Electoral democracy indicators were assessed to understand the relationship between democratic governance and internet access.
    - Freedom of expression metrics were considered to evaluate the relationship between internet access and freedom of speech.
